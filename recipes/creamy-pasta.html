  <h3>This dish can take many different forms depending on what ingredients you currently have in your pantry. The one non-negotiable element is that it MUST be creamy. If she had her way, my child would eat creamy pasta every single day for the rest of her life and honestly, I relate to that.</h2>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <p><ul>
    <li>Pasta (typically penne, but whatever you can find will work)</li>
    <li>Pesto</li>
    <li>Heavy Cream</li>
    <li>A Metric Shit Ton of Parmesan Cheese, grated</li>
    <li>Chicken Breast, diced</li>
  </ul></p>
  <h3>Method</h3>
  <p><ol>
    <li>Fill a pot of water, add salt, and bring it to a boil.</li>
    <li>While you wait for the water to boil, grill diced chicken in a separate pan at medium-high heat. Turn heat to low when the chicken is almost cooked through.</li>
    <li>Add pasta to boiling water.</li>
    <li>Pour a half cup (I think? I eyeball it tbh) of heavy cream into the pan with your chicken. Stir until it begins to thicken.</li>
    <li>Add a cup of grated parmesan and stir until creamy. Again- the creamy part is crucial.</li>
    <li>Drain the pasta and add the chicken and creamy sauce mixture to it. Stir until combined.</li>
    <li>Sigh in resignation when your child ineveitably declares that it needs more salt.</li>
